# AtomicSeats
A fault-tolerant, high-concurrency ticket booking system built with Node.Js, Redis, Kafka, and PostgreSQL. Ensures atomic seat reservations, prevents overselling with distributed locks, supports event-driven workflows, and keeps Redis + DB in sync through idempotent operations and reconciliation.
